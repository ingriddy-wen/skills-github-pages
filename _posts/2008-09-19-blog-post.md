Today was an odd day at school. I had a meeting this morning at 7 am and went to bed a bit too late because of homework so I am a little tired. It is nearing the date of the pSAT so I need to start focusing on that more. My sister's friends cat had suregery a few days ago and today we learned that he was going to be okay even though there were complications with his brain in the surgery so that is very good! Tomorrow is a Friday and the last day of our third week of school. I am not sure if this is what I was supposed to write about in my blog post, but it says I can always change it later so it should be okay.
